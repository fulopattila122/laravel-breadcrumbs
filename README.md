# Laravel Breadcrumbs

A simple Laravel-style way to create breadcrumbs in [Laravel 5.4](http://laravel.com).

## Note
This package is just a fork of [davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs) awesome package.
This fork is intended to make it work with Laravel 5.4 since the original package is **NO LONGER MAINTAINED**.

## Documentation
Please refer to the original [documentation](https://laravel-breadcrumbs.readthedocs.io/) for ref.
**Note** I replace the namespace from `DaveJamesMiller` to `Yajra`.
